# Binary Search Tree Visualization

This project is a simple web-based visualization of a Binary Search Tree (BST). It allows users to dynamically insert, search, and delete nodes while providing a visual representation of the tree on a canvas.

## Features

- **Insert Nodes**: Add nodes to the BST dynamically using the input field or by pressing the "Enter" key.
- **Search Nodes**: Highlights the traversal path during the search operation and marks the target node in yellow.
- **Remove Nodes**: Deletes nodes from the BST while maintaining tree structure.
- **Clear Tree**: A dedicated button to erase all nodes from the tree.
- **Responsive Design**: The visualization adjusts to fit within the canvas.
